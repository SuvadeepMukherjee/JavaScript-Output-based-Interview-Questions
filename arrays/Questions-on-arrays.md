## Questions on Arrays

###### What's the output?

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[10] = 11;
console.log(numbers);
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, null x 7, 11]`
- B: `[1, 2, 3, 11]`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

When you set a value to an element in an array that  exceeds the length of the array, JavaScript creates something called  "empty slots". These actually have the value of `undefined`, but you will see something like:

[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]

depending on where you run it (it's different for every browser, node, etc.)



###### What's the output?

```js
[[0, 1], [2, 3]].reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);
```

- A: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`
- B: `[6, 1, 2]`
- C: `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
- D: `[1, 2, 6]`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`





###### What's the output ?

```js
[1, 2, 3].map(num => {
  if (typeof num === 'number') return;
  return num * 2;
});
```

- A: `[]`
- B: `[null, null, null]`
- C: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`
- D: `[ 3 x empty ]`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

When mapping over the array, the value of `num` is equal to the element it’s currently looping over. In this case, the  elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement `typeof num === "number"` returns `true`. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function.

However, we don’t return a value. When we don’t return a value from the function, the function returns `undefined`. For every element in the array, the function block gets called, so for each element we return `undefined`.



###### What's the output?

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce((x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```

- A: `1` `2` and `3` `3` and `6` `4`
- B: `1` `2` and `2` `3` and `3` `4`
- C: `1` `undefined` and `2` `undefined` and `3` `undefined` and `4` `undefined`
- D: `1` `2` and `undefined` `3` and `undefined` `4`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the *accumulator*, `x` in this case. The second argument is the *current value*, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.

The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.

On the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator, and the current values: `1` and `2` get logged.

If you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged.

On the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.
