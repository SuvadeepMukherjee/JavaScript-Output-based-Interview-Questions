## Questions on functions

#### Q1:What happens when we do this?

```js
function bark() {
  console.log('Woof!');
}

bark.animal = 'dog';
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with  properties. This property is invocable.

#### Q2:Is this a pure function?

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- A: Yes
- B: No

**Answer**:

Answer: A

A pure function is a function that *always* returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The `sum` function always returns the same result. If we pass `1` and `2`, it will *always* return `3` without side effects. If we pass `5` and `10`, it will *always* return `15`, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.

#### Q3:What is the output?

```js
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

By default, arguments have the value of `undefined`, unless a value has been passed to the function. In this case, we didn't pass a value for the `name` argument. `name` is equal to `undefined` which gets logged.

In ES6, we can overwrite this default `undefined` value with default parameters. For example:

`function sayHi(name = "Lydia") { ... }`

In this case, if we didn't pass a value or if we passed `undefined`, `name` would always be equal to the string `Lydia`

#### Q4:What's the output?

```js
function sum(num1, num2 = num1) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}

sum(10);
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `20`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, as long as they've been defined *before* the default parameter. We pass the value `10` to the `sum` function. If the `sum` function only receives 1 argument, it means that the value for `num2` is not passed, and the value of `num1` is equal to the passed value `10` in this case. The default value of `num2` is the value of `num1`, which is `10`. `num1 + num2` returns `20`.

If you're trying to set a default parameter's value equal to a parameter that is defined *after* (to the right), the parameter's value hasn't been initialized yet, which will throw an error.

#### Q5:What's the output?

```js
const add = x => x + x;

function myFunc(num = 2, value = add(num)) {
  console.log(num, value);
}

myFunc();
myFunc(3);
```

- A: `2` `4` and `3` `6`
- B: `2` `NaN` and `3` `NaN`
- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` is the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

#### Q6:What's the output?

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia Hallie',
  hobbies: ['coding'],
};

function addHobby(hobby, hobbies = person.hobbies) {
  hobbies.push(hobby);
  return hobbies;
}

addHobby('running', []);
addHobby('dancing');
addHobby('baking', person.hobbies);

console.log(person.hobbies); 
```

- A: `["coding"]`
- B: `["coding", "dancing"]`
- C: `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`
- D: `["coding", "running", "dancing", "baking"]`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

The `addHobby` function receives two arguments, `hobby` and `hobbies` with the default value of the `hobbies` array on the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"running"` as the value for `hobby` and an empty array as the value for `hobbies`. Since we pass an empty array as the value for `hobbies`, `"running"` gets added to this empty array.

Then, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"dancing"` as the value for `hobby`. We didn't pass a value for `hobbies`, so it gets the default value, the `hobbies` property on the `person` object. We push the hobby `dancing` to the `person.hobbies` array.

Last, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"baking"` as the value for `hobby`, and the `person.hobbies` array as the value for `hobbies`. We push the hobby `baking` to the `person.hobbies` array.

After pushing `dancing` and `baking`, the value of `person.hobbies` is `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`

#### Q7:**What will be the output**

```js
function sum(a=5, b=7){
    return a+b;
}
console.log(sum(undefined, 20));
```

**Answer**:

- **Output** : 25
- **Reason** : Here, undefined is passed as the value for  parameter a, and 20 is passed for parameter b. When any parameter is  undefined, the default value is used.
