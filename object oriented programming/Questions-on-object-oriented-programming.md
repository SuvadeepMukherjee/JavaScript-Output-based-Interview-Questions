## Questions on Object Oriented Programming

###### What's the output?

```js
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = 'green' } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: 'purple' });
console.log(freddie.colorChange('orange'));
```

- A: `orange`
- B: `purple`
- C: `green`
- D: `TypeError`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

The `colorChange` function is static. Static  methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are  created, and cannot be passed down to any children or called upon class  instances. Since `freddie` is an instance of class Chameleon, the function cannot be called upon it. A `TypeError` is thrown.



###### What's the output?

```js
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const member = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
Person.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

console.log(member.getFullName());
```

- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`.

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```



###### What's the output?

```js
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const lydia = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
const sarah = Person('Sarah', 'Smith');

console.log(lydia);
console.log(sarah);
```

- A: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `undefined`
- B: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `Person {firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Smith"}`
- C: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `{}`
- D: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

For `sarah`, we didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the **global object**!

We said that `this.firstName` equals `"Sarah"` and `this.lastName` equals `"Smith"`. What we actually did, is defining `global.firstName = 'Sarah'` and `global.lastName = 'Smith'`. `sarah` itself is left `undefined`, since we don't return a value from the `Person` function.

###### All object have prototypes.

- A: true
- B: false

**Answer**:

Answer: B

All objects have prototypes, except for the **base object**. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of  such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't  find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and  finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.
