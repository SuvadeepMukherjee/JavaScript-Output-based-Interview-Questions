## Questions on this keyword

#### Q1:What's the output?

```js
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

**Answer**:Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

Since there is no value `radius` in the scope of the arrow function, `this.radius` returns `undefined` which, when multiplied by `2 * Math.PI`, results in `NaN`.





###### What is the output?

```js
var status = '😎';

setTimeout(() => {
  const status = '😍';

  const data = {
    status: '🥑',
    getStatus() {
      return this.status;
    },
  };

  console.log(data.getStatus());
  console.log(data.getStatus.call(this));
}, 0);
```

- A: `"🥑"` and `"😍"`
- B: `"🥑"` and `"😎"`
- C: `"😍"` and `"😎"`
- D: `"😎"` and `"😎"`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

The value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to *the object that the method belongs to*. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `"🥑"`.

With the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the *the object that the function belongs to*. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the *global object*, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the *global object*. On the global object, there is a variable called *status* with the value of `"😎"`. When logging `this.status`, `"😎"` gets logged.
