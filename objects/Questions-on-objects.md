## Questions on objects 

Q:Which one is true?

```js
const bird = {
  size: 'small',
};

const mouse = {
  name: 'Mickey',
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

**Answer**:

Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not *type* them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.



###### Q:What's the output?

```js
let c = { greeting: 'Hey!' };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by *reference* when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

![object-references](../assets/object-references.png)

When you change one object, you change all of them.



######  What's the output?

```js
function checkAge(data) {
  if (data === { age: 18 }) {
    console.log('You are an adult!');
  } else if (data == { age: 18 }) {
    console.log('You are still an adult.');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`);
  }
}

checkAge({ age: 18 });
```

- A: `You are an adult!`
- B: `You are still an adult.`
- C: `Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

When testing equality, primitives are compared by their *value*, while objects are compared by their *reference*. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.

The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in  memory than the object we used in order to check equality.

This is why both `{ age: 18 } === { age: 18 }` and `{ age: 18 } == { age: 18 }` return `false`.



###### What's the output?

```js
const obj = { 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c' };
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

obj.hasOwnProperty('1');
obj.hasOwnProperty(1);
set.has('1');
set.has(1);
```

- A: `false` `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `true` `true` `true`
- C: `true` `true` `false` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `true` `true`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why `obj.hasOwnProperty('1')` also returns true.

It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no `'1'` in our set: `set.has('1')` returns `false`. It has the numeric type `1`, `set.has(1)` returns `true`.





###### What's the output?

```js
const obj = { a: 'one', b: 'two', a: 'three' };
console.log(obj);
```

- A: `{ a: "one", b: "two" }`
- B: `{ b: "two", a: "three" }`
- C: `{ a: "three", b: "two" }`
- D: `SyntaxError`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

If you have two keys with the same name, the key will be  replaced. It will still be in its first position, but with the last  specified value.



###### What's the output?

```js
const a = {};
const b = { key: 'b' };
const c = { key: 'c' };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);
```

- A: `123`
- B: `456`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.





###### What's the output?

```js
let person = { name: 'Lydia' };
const members = [person];
person = null;

console.log(members);
```

- A: `null`
- B: `[null]`
- C: `[{}]`
- D: `[{ name: "Lydia" }]`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

First, we declare a variable `person` with the value of an object that has a `name` property.

![obj1](../assets/obj1.png)

Then, we declare a variable called `members`. We set the first element of that array equal to the value of the `person` variable. Objects interact by *reference* when setting them equal to each other. When you assign a reference from one variable to another, you make a *copy* of that reference. (note that they don't have the *same* reference!)

![obj2](../assets/obj2.png)

Then, we set the variable `person` equal to `null`.

![obj3](../assets/obj3.png)

We are only modifying the value of the `person` variable, and not the first element in the array, since that element has a different  (copied) reference to the object. The first element in `members` still holds its reference to the original object. When we log the `members` array, the first element still holds the value of the object, which gets logged.





###### What's the output?

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

for (const item in person) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia" }, { age: 21 }`
- B: `"name", "age"`
- C: `"Lydia", 21`
- D: `["name", "Lydia"], ["age", 21]`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys, in this case `name` and `age`. Under the hood, object keys are strings (if they're not a Symbol). On every loop, we set the value of `item` equal to the current key it’s iterating over. First, `item` is equal to `name`, and gets logged. Then, `item` is equal to `age`, which gets logged.



###### What's the output?

```js
const person = { name: 'Lydia' };

Object.defineProperty(person, 'age', { value: 21 });

console.log(person);
console.log(Object.keys(person));
```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`, `["name", "age"]`
- B: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`, `["name"]`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia"}`, `["name", "age"]`
- D: `{ name: "Lydia"}`, `["age"]`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default *not enumerable*. The `Object.keys` method returns all *enumerable* property names from an object, in this case only `"name"`.

Properties added using the `defineProperty` method are immutable by default. You can override this behavior using the `writable`, `configurable` and `enumerable` properties. This way, the `defineProperty` method gives you a lot more control over the properties you're adding to an object.



###### What's the output?

```js
const settings = {
  username: 'lydiahallie',
  level: 19,
  health: 90,
};

const data = JSON.stringify(settings, ['level', 'health']);
console.log(data);
```

- A: `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`
- B: `"{"username": "lydiahallie"}"`
- C: `"["level", "health"]"`
- D: `"{"username": "lydiahallie", "level":19, "health":90}"`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

The second argument of `JSON.stringify` is the *replacer*. The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an *array*, only the property  names included in the array will be added to the JSON string. In this  case, only the properties with the names `"level"` and `"health"` are included, `"username"` is excluded. `data` is now equal to `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`.

If the replacer is a *function*, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying. The value  returned from this function will be the value of the property when it's  added to the JSON string. If the value is `undefined`, this property is excluded from the JSON string.





###### What's the output?

```js
const box = { x: 10, y: 20 };

Object.freeze(box);

const shape = box;
shape.x = 100;

console.log(shape);
```

- A: `{ x: 100, y: 20 }`
- B: `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`
- C: `{ x: 100 }`
- D: `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` would return true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.



###### What is the output?

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

let city = person.city;
city = 'Amsterdam';

console.log(person);
```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- B: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: "Amsterdam" }`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: undefined }`
- D: `"Amsterdam"`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

We set the variable `city` equal to the value of the property called `city` on the `person` object. There is no property on this object called `city`, so the variable `city` has the value of `undefined`.

Note that we are *not* referencing the `person` object itself! We simply set the variable `city` equal to the current value of the `city` property on the `person` object.

Then, we set `city` equal to the string `"Amsterdam"`. This doesn't change the person object: there is no reference to that object.

When logging the `person` object, the unmodified object gets returned.



###### What's the output?

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const member = new Person('John');
console.log(typeof member);
```

- A: `"class"`
- B: `"function"`
- C: `"object"`
- D: `"string"`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

Classes are syntactical sugar for function constructors. The equivalent of the `Person` class as a function constructor would be:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

​    Calling a function constructor with `new` results in the creation of an instance of `Person`, `typeof` keyword returns `"object"` for an instance. `typeof member` returns `"object"`.





###### What's the output?

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

for (const [x, y] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(x, y);
}
```

- A: `name` `Lydia` and `age` `21`
- B: `["name", "Lydia"]` and `["age", 21]`
- C: `["name", "age"]` and `undefined`
- D: `Error`

**Answer**:

Answer: A



`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over  each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can  destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged. The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.





###### What's the output?

```js
const info = {
  [Symbol('a')]: 'b',
};

console.log(info);
console.log(Object.keys(info));    
```

- A: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `["{Symbol('a')"]`
- B: `{}` and `[]`
- C: `{ a: "b" }` and `["a"]`
- D: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `[]`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

A Symbol is not *enumerable*. The Object.keys method returns all *enumerable* key properties on an object. The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty  array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will  be visible, even non-enumerable ones.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides  representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name  collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that  want to add properties to the same object), you can also "hide"  properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still  access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).



###### What's its value?

```js
function compareMembers(person1, person2 = person) {
  if (person1 !== person2) {
    console.log('Not the same!');
  } else {
    console.log('They are the same!');
  }
}

const person = { name: 'Lydia' };

compareMembers(person);
```

- A: `Not the same!`
- B: `They are the same!`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `SyntaxError`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.





###### What's its value?

```js
const colorConfig = {
  red: true,
  blue: false,
  green: true,
  black: true,
  yellow: false,
};

const colors = ['pink', 'red', 'blue'];

console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]);
```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation. In this example, we use dot  notation (`colorConfig.colors`) instead of bracket notation (`colorConfig["colors"]`).

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property  on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. If we would've used `colorConfig[colors[1]]`, it would have returned the value of the `red` property on the `colorConfig` object.





###### What's the output?

```js
const food = ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = '🍝';

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'🍕'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types don't interact by reference.

In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by *value*. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'🍕'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more)

Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a *copy* of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`.



###### What does this method do?

```js
JSON.parse();
```

- A: Parses JSON to a JavaScript value
- B: Parses a JavaScript object to JSON
- C: Parses any JavaScript value to JSON
- D: Parses JSON to a JavaScript object only

**Answer**:

Answer: A

With the `JSON.parse()` method, we can parse JSON string to a JavaScript value.

```js
// Stringifying a number into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonNumber = JSON.stringify(4); // '4'
JSON.parse(jsonNumber); // 4

// Stringifying an array value into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // '[1, 2, 3]'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Stringifying an object  into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify({ name: 'Lydia' }); // '{"name":"Lydia"}'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // { name: 'Lydia' }
```
