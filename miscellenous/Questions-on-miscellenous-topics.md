## Questions on Miscellenous Topics

###### What's the output?

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) continue;
  console.log(i);
}
```

- A: `1` `2`
- B: `1` `2` `3`
- C: `1` `2` `4`
- D: `1` `3` `4`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

The `continue` statement skips an iteration if a certain condition returns `true`.



###### What's the output?

```js
console.log(typeof typeof 1);
```

- A: `"number"`
- B: `"string"`
- C: `"object"`
- D: `"undefined"`

**Answer**:

#### Answer: B

typeof 1` returns `"number"`. `typeof "number"` returns `"string"





###### Everything in JavaScript is either a...

- A: primitive or object
- B: function or object
- C: trick question! only objects
- D: number or object

**Answer**:

Answer: A

JavaScript only has primitive types and objects.

Primitive types are `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

What differentiates a primitive from an object is that  primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note  that `'foo'.toUpperCase()` evaluates to `'FOO'` and does not result in a `TypeError`. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a  primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive  type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates. All primitives except for `null` and `undefined` exhibit this behavior.





###### What's the value of `num`?

```js
const num = parseInt('7*6', 10);
```

- A: `42`
- B: `"42"`
- C: `7`
- D: `NaN`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

Only the first number in the string is returned. Based on the *radix* (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the `parseInt` checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it  encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops  parsing and ignores the following characters.

`*` is not a valid number. It only parses `"7"` into the decimal `7`. `num` now holds the value of `7`.





###### What's the output ? 

```js
function greeting() {
  throw 'Hello world!';
}

function sayHi() {
  try {
    const data = greeting();
    console.log('It worked!', data);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Oh no an error:', e);
  }
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `It worked! Hello world!`
- B: `Oh no an error: undefined`
- C: `SyntaxError: can only throw Error objects`
- D: `Oh no an error: Hello world!`

**Answer**:

Answer: D

With the `throw` statement, we can create custom errors. With this statement, you can throw exceptions. An exception can be a **string**, a **number**, a **boolean** or an **object**. In this case, our exception is the string `'Hello world!'`.

With the `catch` statement, we can specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. An exception is thrown: the string `'Hello world!'`. `e` is now equal to that string, which we log. This results in `'Oh an error: Hello world!'`.





###### What's the output?

```js
const name = 'Lydia';
age = 21;

console.log(delete name);
console.log(delete age);
```

- A: `false`, `true`
- B: `"Lydia"`, `21`
- C: `true`, `true`
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const`, or `let` keywords cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.



###### What's the output?

```js
function nums(a, b) {
  if (a > b) console.log('a is bigger');
  else console.log('b is bigger');
  return
  a + b;
}

console.log(nums(4, 2));
console.log(nums(1, 2));
```

- A: `a is bigger`, `6` and `b is bigger`, `3`
- B: `a is bigger`, `undefined` and `b is bigger`, `undefined`
- C: `undefined` and `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't *have* to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a *new line*. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's  actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically  added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```js
return;
a + b;
```

​    This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!



###### What's the output?

```js
const name = 'Lydia';

console.log(name());
```

- A: `SyntaxError`
- B: `ReferenceError`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

The variable `name` holds the value of a string, which is not a function, and thus cannot be invoked.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected `name` to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word `return` as `retrun`. ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.



###### What's the output?

```js
const name = 'Lydia Hallie';
const age = 21;

console.log(Number.isNaN(name));
console.log(Number.isNaN(age));

console.log(isNaN(name));
console.log(isNaN(age));
```

- A: `true` `false` `true` `false`
- B: `true` `false` `false` `false`
- C: `false` `false` `true` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `false` `true`

**Answer**:

Answer: C

With the `Number.isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is a *numeric value* and equal to `NaN`. `name` is not a numeric value, so `Number.isNaN(name)` returns `false`. `age` is a numeric value, but is not equal to `NaN`, so `Number.isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

With the `isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is not a number. `name` is not a number, so `isNaN(name)` returns true. `age` is a number, so `isNaN(age)` returns `false`.





###### What's the output?

```js
function getFruit(fruits) {
	console.log(fruits?.[1]?.[1])
}

getFruit([['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']])
getFruit()
getFruit([['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']])
```

- A: `null`, `undefined`, 🍌
- B: `[]`, `null`, 🍌
- C: `[]`, `[]`, 🍌
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`, 🍌

**Answer**:

Answer: D

The `?` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects. We're trying to log the item on index `1` within the subarray that's on index `1` of the `fruits` array. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array doesn't exist, it'll simply return `undefined`. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array exists, but this subarray doesn't have an item on its `1` index, it'll also return `undefined`.

First, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍍']` subarray of `[['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']]`. This subarray only contains one item, which means there is no item on index `1`, and returns `undefined`.

Then, we're invoking the `getFruits` function without passing a value as an argument, which means that `fruits` has a value of `undefined` by default. Since we're conditionally chaining the item on index `1` of`fruits`, it returns `undefined` since this item on index `1` does not exist.

Lastly, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍊', '🍌']` subarray of `['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']`. The item on index `1` within this subarray is `🍌`, which gets logged.





###### What's the output?

```js
let randomValue = { name: "Lydia" }
randomValue = 23

if (!typeof randomValue === "string") {
	console.log("It's not a string!")
} else {
	console.log("Yay it's a string!")
}
```

- A: `It's not a string!`
- B: `Yay it's a string!`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

The condition within the `if` statement checks whether the value of `!typeof randomValue` is equal to `"string"`. The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`. In this case, the returned value of `typeof randomValue` is the truthy value `"number"`, meaning that the value of `!typeof randomValue` is the boolean value `false`.

`!typeof randomValue === "string"` always returns false, since we're actually checking `false === "string"`. Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it's a string!` gets logged.
