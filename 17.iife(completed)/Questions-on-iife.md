## Questions on iife

#### Q1:What's the output?

```js
function sayHi() {
  return (() => 0)();
}

console.log(typeof sayHi());
```

- A: `"object"`
- B: `"number"`
- C: `"function"`
- D: `"undefined"`

**Answer**:

Answer: B

The `sayHi` function returns the returned value of the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This function returned `0`, which is type `"number"`.

FYI: `typeof` can return the following list of values: `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string`, `symbol`, `function` and `object`. Note that `typeof null` returns `"object"`.

#### Q2:What's the output?

```js
(() => {
  let x, y;
  try {
    throw new Error();
  } catch (x) {
    (x = 1), (y = 2);
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
})();
```

- A: `1` `undefined` `2`
- B: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- C: `1` `1` `2`
- D: `1` `undefined` `undefined`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

The `catch` block receives the argument `x`. This is not the same `x` as the variable when we pass arguments. This variable `x` is block-scoped.

Later, we set this block-scoped variable equal to `1`, and set the value of the variable `y`. Now, we log the block-scoped variable `x`, which is equal to `1`.

Outside of the `catch` block, `x` is still `undefined`, and `y` is `2`. When we want to `console.log(x)` outside of the `catch` block, it returns `undefined`, and `y` returns `2`.

#### Q3:What's the output?

```js
(() => {
  let x = (y = 10);
})();

console.log(typeof x);
console.log(typeof y);
```

- A: `"undefined", "number"`
- B: `"number", "number"`
- C: `"object", "number"`
- D: `"number", "undefined"`

**Answer**:

Answer: A

`let x = (y = 10);` is actually shorthand for:

```js
y = 10;
let x = y;
```

 When we set `y` equal to `10`, we actually add a property `y` to the global object (`window` in the browser, `global` in Node). In a browser, `window.y` is now equal to `10`.

Then, we declare a variable `x` with the value of `y`, which is `10`. Variables declared with the `let` keyword are *block scoped*, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the  immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `"undefined"`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `"undefined"`.

However, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`. This value is accessible anywhere in our code. `y` is defined, and holds a value of type `"number"`. `console.log(typeof y)` returns `"number"`.
